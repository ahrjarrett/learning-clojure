# Clojure Practice

This is for practicing Clojure data types and notes that I’ve taken along with them. This project is based on my own reading of O’Reilly’s [Clojure Programming: Practical Lisp for the Java World](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920013754.do).

### TODO:
- Find a Vim plugin that does more than just syntax highlighting--for example, access to a REPL from inside command mode.
- Dig into `lein` commands, how to install dependencies, where are they coming from (is there a dependency mgr like NPM?).
- Consider going back to Spacemacs for access to some Emacs bindings?
- What the hell is a class path? Ugh Java stuff. Research.
